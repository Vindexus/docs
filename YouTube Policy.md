## Gaming Policy

Monstercat and its artists are gamers! We have invested thousands of hours of our lives destroying zombies, building elaborate worlds, raiding end-game bosses, levelling up etc. It is a very large part of our lives!

In saying this, understand that we love the videos (machinimas, walk-throughs, montages etc) that many of you create! We are often asked what our policy is for using our music in YouTube videos – here it is!

Update - January 17th, 2015

We have opened up our licensed music to the world! 

Option 1:
Content creators can now purchase a License from https://license.monstercat.com/. This includes downloadable access to our catalogue of over 800 songs and the addition of your channel to our Whitelist protecting your channel from any Content ID claims. You can 100% monetize your content on YouTube and Twitch with a Monstercat license!

Option 2:
Content creators can continue to use Monstercat music that has been purchased from approved stores without a Monstercat license. You will receive a Content claim on your video and you will be unable to monetize your content on YouTube. This guarantees that the original musician fairly receives a % of the audio portion of the advertising earnings. 

We ask that all music used in a video be credited in the video description using the following format:

Artist Name:
Video Link: (Search for the Monstercat video of the track)
iTunes Download Link: 
Label Channel: http://www.YouTube.com/Monstercat
Artist Social links:

Option 3:
Content creators can apply to join the Monstercat Partner Program where they will receive a complementary Monstercat license at zero cost. This program is extremely limited and only open to highly influential content creators. Apply here:http://bit.ly/LicensingRequest


Monstercat Music Licensing – YouTube Gaming Policy:

MONSTERCAT WILL NEVER STRIKE A VIDEO USING OUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MUSIC IN A GAMING CENTRIC VIDEO

Monstercat music can be used in all video gaming content. 

We ask that all music used in a video be credited in the video description using the following format:

Artist Name:
Video Link: (Search for the Monstercat video of the track)
Beatport Download Link: 
Label Channel: http://www.YouTube.com/Monstercat
Artist Social links:

A content-id match will automatically be applied to videos using our music. This guarantees that the original musician fairly receives a % of the audio portion of the advertising earnings. This does not affect the video or channel in any way. We have strong relationships with every major gaming network. (ie Machinima, Curse, TGS, Fullscreen, TGN)

Finally, we do offer FREE commercial licenses to select content creators. This includes a 100% monetizable commercial license, our complete catalogue of music and a slew of free merch! Apply here:http://bit.ly/LicensingRequest

These policies do not ONLY apply to gaming but to all YouTube video content. We want to wish you all the best and can't wait to see the videos that you create!

[Note] Some people have been counter-claiming these automated claims. If you do not have a license then we ask that you do not counter-claim. We will have to hand out a strike if a claim is counter-claimed repeatedly. This is only fair to the original artists. 

## Promoter Channel Policy
Not many people know this but Monstercat launched in August of 2011 as a YouTube promotion channel/record label. It was a place for our friends to share music, cross promote each other and learn. We truly never expected it grow into the record label that we are today! 

Since then, we have worked with countless other promotional channels to help develop their brand using the tools and connections we have developed over the past year. At the end of the day though, it was their original branding, their choice of music and their efforts that have shown them success, we were just an aid.

In saying this, know that we do value the service that YouTube promotion channels provide to up and coming artists and we are willing to work out ways for them to use our released music in their videos. Here is our official policy:

Monstercat Music Licensing – YouTube Promotor Channel Policy


MONSTERCAT WILL NEVER STRIKE A VIDEO USING OUR PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MUSIC

In the following cases, we will block a video worldwide:
(This is not a Strike and will not affect your channel in any way)
The video is posted before the release is posted to the Official Monstercat Channel. 
The video includes filesharing links.
The video includes edited original music (ie. Bass Boosted - This is not how the artists intended for their music to be heard. Please respect that.
We ask that all music used in a video be credited in the video description using the following format:

Artist Name:

A content-id match will automatically be applied to videos using our music. This guarantees that the original musician fairly receives a % of the audio portion of the advertising earnings. Visual portions and a % of the audio revenue is still claimable by the original channel.

Members of the "The District" YouTube network will receive a 100% monetization license to monetize all of our content in addition to all other network provided services. Some partners in this program include Tasty Network, Trap and Bass, Liquicity, MrSuicideSheep, Pandoric, Spread the Jams and many more. Apply here: http://www.edmdistrict.com/apply/

We understand that the internet is a place for sharing and we appreciate all of the support we continue to receive from the family. We just ask that you please respect the original artists and their work - it is their livelihood!

Edit 1: If Content-ID matches are disputed and you have not received permission to upload our music, we are forced by YouTube to place a strike on the video. This will also occur on channels who have uploaded the music before it is publicly available on the Monstercat channel.

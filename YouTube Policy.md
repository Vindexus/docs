## Gaming Policy

Monstercat and its artists are gamers! We have invested thousands of hours of our lives destroying zombies, building elaborate worlds, raiding end-game bosses, leveling up etc. It is a very large part of our lives!

In saying this, understand that we love the videos (machinimas, walk-throughs, montages etc) that many of you create! We are often asked what our policy is for using our music in YouTube videos – here it is!

We have opened up our licensed music to the world! 

**Option 1:**  
Content creators can now purchase a License from https://www.monstercat.com/licensing/content-creators. This includes the addition of your channel to our Whitelist protecting your channel from any Content ID claims, allowing you to use our catalogue of over 1000 videos in your videos. You can 100% monetize your content on YouTube and Twitch with a Monstercat license!

**Option 2:**  
Content creators can continue to use Monstercat music that has been purchased from approved stores without a Monstercat license. You will receive a Content claim on your video and you will be unable to monetize your content on YouTube. This guarantees that the original musician fairly receives a % of the audio portion of the advertising earnings.

We ask that you credit the artists using the format describe below.

**Option 3:**  
Content creators can apply to join the Monstercat Partner Program where they will receive a complementary Monstercat license at zero cost. This program is extremely limited and only open to highly influential content creators. Apply here:http://bit.ly/LicensingRequest

These policies do not ONLY apply to gaming but to all YouTube video content. We want to wish you all the best and can't wait to see the videos that you create!

[Note] Some people have been counter-claiming these automated claims. If you do not have a license then we ask that you do not counter-claim. We will have to hand out a strike if a claim is counter-claimed repeatedly. This is only fair to the original artists.

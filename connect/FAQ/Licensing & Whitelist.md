# Licensing and Whitelisting FAQs

### When I first sign up, how long will it take for my channel to be whitelisted? Will all my past Content ID claims be removed?

Your channel will be whitelisted with past Content ID claims removed within 24 hours of subscribing. If for some reason neither were done within 24 hours, please message us and we will sort your issue. Please refrain from uploading any videos until your Connect account shows that you are whitelisted.

### Can I add more channels after initially subscribing?
Yes! You can add more channels for additional cost through your account profile.

### Connect is warning me that a specific track is not available for licensing. Does this mean I cannot use it in my content?

We have a short list of tracks that are not covered under the Monstercat License. 

### Is crediting required when I have a Monstercat License?

Crediting is not required when you have a Monstercat License, but appreciate any provided.

### What if I don't use Twitch? Can I just use that empty channel slot for another YouTube channel?

The standard $14.99 Monstercat License only includes one YouTube and one Twitch channel whitelist. They cannot be switched between platforms.

### What if my video is non-commercial or non-profit? Do I still need a license?

Yes, you will still need a license if you do not want Content-ID matches to appear on your video.

### What does purchasing a subscription do?

Purchasing a subscription gives the purchaser unlimited access to the Monstercat catalogue in addition to being whitelisted from receiving any Content-ID matches on YouTube or VOD mutes on Twitch.

### I own a Music Promotional Channel, can I purchase a license to monetize Monstercatâ€™s music on my channel?

Monstercat licenses do not include the ability to commercially host our music on a promotional channel.

### When my Monstercat License subscription ends, what happens to the videos that have existing Monstercat music?

When your subscription expires, your videos will still remain public and will not be striked or blocked under any circumstances. Content ID matches will be re-enabled on your videos until you choose to re-subscribe.

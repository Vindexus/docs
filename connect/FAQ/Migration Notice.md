# Connect Migration Notice

### What is changing?
 - Gold is $5/mo instead of $10/mo
 - YouTube whitelisting is $10/mo for 20 months OR $200 one time
 - Twitch whitelisting is $5/mo for 20 months OR $100 one time
 - Beam has been added and is $5/mo for 20 months or $100 one time

Once you have paid for 20 months OR paid the one time fee, **your channel is paid off**.

### What happens when my channel is fully **paid off**?
Any videos you upload while subscribed won't get copyright claims, even if you unsubscribe.

### What happens after 20 months?
After 20 months your channel is fully **paid off**, and you'll continue to not get any claims.

### What if I cancel before my channel is paid off?
If you cancel your subscription before your channel is paid off your videos will be subject to content ID copyright claims. You can remove those claims by resubscribing.

## I'm an existing customer, what happens to me?

### Will I need to pay more?
No, everyone being migrated over will end up paying less.

### Do I need to do anything?
Nope! We'll handle the migration to the new service.

### I only had the Gold subscription, what happens now?
Your monthly subscription will be cheaper, $5/mo instead of $10/mo

### I was paying for some YouTube or Twitch channel licenses, what happens now?
Your existing channels will be considered fully paid off. You'll continue to not get copyright claims on them, but you won't have to keep paying.  
Your monthly subscription will be changed to a Gold subscription of $5/mo, which gives you download access to the catalog.

### What if I add new channels?
If you add new channels you will have to pay for those.

### I used Stripe to pay, what happens now?
Your subscription will be reduced to the $5/month Gold Membership as described and you will automatically be given free number of months prorated to your credits or what you have already pre-paid.

### I used PayPal to pay, what happens now?
If you have a month to month subscription your subscription will be reduced to the $5/month Gold Membership and you will be given a coupon for any remaining credits. The coupon is only redeemable for Gold subscription.

If you have an irregular subscription (non-monthly) your subscription will be canceled and you will receive a coupon code with free months you are owed. If you want you may also alternatively request a refund for any remaining months.

### Where do I use my coupon code?
Because of the way PayPal works, you'll have to first cancel your Gold subscription, then recreate it with the coupon code.

1. Cancel your subscription by clicking *Cancel Subscription* on the right side of this page: https://www.monstercat.com/account/services
2. Refresh the page at https://www.monstercat.com/account/services
3. Enter your coupon code in the *Special Code* field on the right side of that page

### Why the difference for PayPal subscribers?

The PayPal API does not allow us to modify your payment period or give you free access for any number of months.

### What does this mean for extra credit?
Due to the complexities and required maintenance we have decided to discontinue the extra credit referral system. If you have credit please contact connect@monstercat.com

## General Questions

### Will a whitelist subscription give me download access to the catalog?
No, a Gold subscription is what gives you access to download songs from the catalog.

### What happens to the current Connect platform?
You can still continue to use the old Connect platform until we decide it is appropriate to discontinue it and all of our users have been migrated successfully. Once this point has been reached you must access the catalog and your subscriptions through Monstercat.com.

### When will migration occur?

The migration will begin in the coming weeks and it will be done in batches to ensure a smooth transition for all users. We estimate final migration to complete by September 1, 2016.

### Signing a Contract

Once your track is entered into the system, a contract is created that must be signed by all parties/artists/songwriters before the contract can be executed.

You will receive an email notification that a contract is pending your signature. To accept the terms of the contract, enter your password and click ‘Accept Terms and Conditions’. Your contract status will update automatically.

If more than one signature is required, you can easily view who has signed the contract by looking at the Recipient Details.

Once all recipients have signed the contract it will be made available as a pdf with your digital signature rendered into a QR code. See ‘Is signing online safe for me’ for more information.

### Contract Details

The contract details summarize the contract terms in a simple table. You can view the recipients, their respective commission breakdown and whether or not they have signed it. You can also see the release date, who the contract was created by and the term.

### Is signing online safe for me?

Yes! We have taken every measure possible to correctly identify that you were the person who actually signed the contract. Once you enter your password verifying your account identity, we generate a QR code containing all of your session information. If you scan this code you can see information such as your IP address, date and hashed password.

### How come there are no contracts in my documents?

We are working to upload your existing physically signed contracts. If there are any outstanding contracts you will be able to digitally sign them with the Connect system.
